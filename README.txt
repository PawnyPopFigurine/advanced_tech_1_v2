Welcome to Block Buster Bonanza!

This game is built for gamepad and voice commands (though the mouse does work for UI navigation).

In gameplay, blocks come towards the player. If any blocks hit the player, the game ends.
The player must press the button matching the closest block coming at them to destroy it.

In addition to physical button presses, players can say the voice term corresponding to whichever desired button.
Multiple terms can be said within one unit of recording, and the game should respond to all sequentially.

The user can set their own voice commands in the settings menu. Terms must be one single word.

The user can change the region or language of the speech recognition in the settings menu. The project supports 81 different regions.

The 'UI Back' command is used to quickly return from Settings to Main Menu, as well as collapsing the region dropdown.

The 'Scroll Rise' and 'Scroll Drop' commands are used for fast navigation across multiple options when scrolling, in both the primary scroll and region dropdown menu. On Gamepad, L1 is Drop and L2 is Rise.

In gameplay, the speed of blocks increases over time. Users can restrict the max block speed in the settings menu.
